    <h1>Joshua Shuller's Personal and Professional Website</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Joshua Shuller, a software engineer passionate about creating innovative web experiences. 
      This repository is home to the codebase for my personal and professional website, where I plan to showcase my projects, 
      share insights, and connect with fellow developers and potential employers.
    </p>

    <h2>Under Construction</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the website is still under construction, and I'm working hard to bring it to life. 
      However, I've encountered challenges with online bots consuming CPU resources, despite implementing Google Captcha. 
      As a result, the website may experience performance issues or downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, I plan to implement additional security measures to mitigate the impact of bots on website performance. 
      I'm also working on adding new features, refining the design, and updating content regularly to provide a valuable experience for visitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any suggestions, insights, or feedback that could help improve the website or address the bot-related issues, 
      please feel free to reach out. Your input is greatly appreciated!
    </p>

    <p>
      Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and improve my personal and professional website.
